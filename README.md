# SpaceX API-App

A custom made single page web-app created using pretty much only React.js.

Some "Location" links on the ship API give a 404 response on vesselfinder.com, I believe this is because there is no recent data for the ship.
At the time of writing this the "Betty R Gambarella" ship "Location" link works fine for me and others might start/stop working as time goes on.
